    I wish i could just get through this and it that this wouldn't be such a learning curve. Sometimes i think this is also a self sabotage thing. So sorta saying that i do understand how this works and that i would do so well once i have this under
    my belt. That person wouldn't be the only person that knows and i dont have to feel shitty. I would possibly even leave this place and move into UX and make better bank. ha!</p>

  <p>I have been wanting a blog, journal thing. Somewhere where i can talk about just what has been rattling around in my brain and maybe jot some ideas in a locked spot. maybe make an app that logs into this site to document all sorts of ideas and
    possible inventions. But essentially just giving me the opportunity to practice some of this developer stuff that I have yet to cover. now that Q is leaving, i think it could possibly be a good place to continue working. I mean, Q is a fine
    person but man, with that type of boss who needs enemies.</p>
